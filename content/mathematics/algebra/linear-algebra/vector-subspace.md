Let $\nu$ be a vector space and a space $W$ is called a vector subspace of $\nu$ if and only if,

> - $W \sube \nu$
> - $W$ is itself a vector space with respect to the operations from $\nu$

in fact, we don't need to verify all the axioms of vector space for $W$. In order to determine if $W \sube \nu$ is a subspace of $\nu$ we only need to verify the following,

> - $W \neq \empty$ (Check $0 \in W$)
> - $W_1 + W_2 \in W$ (Closure under +)
> - $\alpha W \in W$ (Close under scalar multiplication)
