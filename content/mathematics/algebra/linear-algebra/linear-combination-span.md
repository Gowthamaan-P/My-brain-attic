Linear combination is the sum of scalar multiples of $k$ vectors. By definition,

> A linear combination $C$ of $k$ vectors $(v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k)$ is defined as, $$C= \alpha_1v_1 + \alpha_2v_2 + \dots + \alpha_kv_k, $$ where $(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots, \alpha_k \in \mathbb{F})$

## Span

Let us consider $k$ vectors such that $(v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k \in \nu)$. Now, define a set $W$ such that the elements of the set are linear combinations of vectors in $\nu$.

$$
W = \lbrace u \mid u = \alpha_1v_1 + \alpha_2v_2 + \dots + \alpha_vu_k, \alpha_i \in \mathbb{F} \rbrace \\\\
W = \lbrace u \mid u = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \alpha_iv_i, \alpha_i \in \mathbb{F} \rbrace
$$

Look into the fact, that the defined $W$ is a subspace. Let's prove this theorem. For $W$ to be a subspace, it has to satisfy the three conditions defined [here](vector-subspace.md),

- $W \neq \empty$, since $u_i \in W$
- $W$ is closed in scalar multiplication, sine for any element $u = \alpha_1v_1 + \alpha_2v_2 + \dots + \alpha_vu_k$ the scalar multiple is,
  $\alpha u = \alpha(\alpha_1v_1 + \alpha_2v_2 + \dots + \alpha_vu_k) = \alpha\alpha_1v_1 + \alpha\alpha_2v_2 + \dots + \alpha\alpha_vu_k$. Here, $\alpha\alpha_i \in W$. So, $W$ is closed under scalar multiplication.
- Consider two general elements from $W$, $\sum_{i=1}^{k} \alpha_iv_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{k} \beta_iv_i$. The addition of these elements, $\sum_{i=1}^{k} \alpha_iv_i + \sum_{i=1}^{k} \beta_iv_i =  \sum_{i=1}^{k} (\alpha_i + \beta_i)v_i$ and $(\alpha_i + \beta_i) \in \mathbb{F}$ as $\alpha_i, \beta_i \in \mathbb{F}$. So, $W$ is closed under addition.

So, the set of all linear combinations of $k$ vectors of a vector space $\nu$ is a sub space of $\nu$. This set is called as span.

> The span $W$ of a vector space $\nu$ is defined as the collection of all possible linear combinations of the given $k$ vectors from $\nu$.
> $$W =  \text{span}\lbrace v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k \rbrace$$

**Remarks**

- A span is a subspace generated by $k$ specific vectors
- $W$ is the smallest possible subspace of $\nu$
- The set $\lbrace v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k \rbrace$ is called the spanning set

## Linear Combination and System of Equations

Consider a system $Ax = b$. Another way of expressing this system is,

$$x_1A_1 + x_2A_2+ \dots + x_nA_n = b,$$

where $A_i$ are the columns of the matrix $A_{m\times n}$.

From the above we can observe that,

> - The system $Ax=b$ has a solution if and only if, $b$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$
> - In other words, the system $Ax=b$ has a solution if and only if, $b \in \text{span}\lbrace A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n\rbrace$

## Determining if x belongs to a span

**Objective**: Suppose we have a span (i.e) the subspace spanned by a set of vectors $\lbrace v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k \rbrace$. Now a pick a vector $x$ and verify whether it belongs to the subspace.

Let us do few examples and generalize this idea.

> Let $u_1 = \begin{bmatrix} -3 \\\\ 1 \\\\-1 \end{bmatrix}$, $u_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ -2 \\\\1 \end{bmatrix}$. Determine if $v = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$ is in $W = \text{span}\lbrace u_1, u_2 \rbrace.$

**Solution**

A span is a collection of linear combination of vectors. So, we can rewrite the above question as, is $v$ can be expressed as a linear combination of $u_1$ and $u_2$? If so, $v \in W$ (i.e) $v = \alpha_1u_1 + \alpha_2u_2$

Now, the next question is that, are there $\alpha_1, \alpha_2 \in \mathbb{R}$ such that,

$$
\alpha_1u_1 + \alpha_2u_2 = v
$$

$$
\alpha_1\begin{bmatrix} -3 \\\\ 1 \\\\-1 \end{bmatrix} + \alpha_2\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ -2 \\\\1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

This is a system of equations of form $Ax = b$. If rewrite the above,

$$
\begin{bmatrix} -3&5 \\\\ 1&-2 \\\\-1&1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \alpha_1 \\\\ \alpha_2\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

If a solution exists for the above system, it implies that $v \in W$. By solving this system, we get $\alpha_1 = 3, \alpha_2 = 2$

> **Remark: Questions about spans and linear combinations can be translated to system of equations and vice versa.**
