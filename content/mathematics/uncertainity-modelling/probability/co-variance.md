# Covariance
If co-variance is zero, the given X and Y are linearly independent. There can be non-linear relationship.

Absolute independence, Linear independence and dependence -> Prove using probability. 

If X and Y are uncorrelated and follow 2D Gaussian distribution, they are independent. 

Variance and Covariance matrix - 

# Questions
What is Expectation? What are the rules and formulas with expectation?
What is a moment? Explain its significance and working.
Difference between Mean and Expectation.
What is Iterative expectation?
What is prediction here? What is MMSE production?
What is data and population world?
Why expectation operates in the population world?


# Linear Regression
Linear Regression is linear in terms of the parameters. 
Differentiate the predictor and model.
    Predictor tells you how to predict. When you have define the loss, then only model arises.
