## About

"My Brain Attic" is a collection of my personal notes, insights, and summaries from courses, books, and other learning resources. The name is inspired by the concept described by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's character, Sherlock Holmes, who likened the human brain to an attic, where knowledge is stored.

I believe in the power of continuous learning, and this repository serves as both a reference for myself and potentially a resource for others interested in similar topics.
